# Example


# The return keyword is used to terminate a function and output a value:
def add(x, y):
    answer = x + y
    return answer


# So a return keyword is added, plus the variable we want to output.
# Now when we call the function, there will be an output that we can play with:

total = add(4.99, 9.99)  # total is 14.98

# This means that we can actually print out a function call! ðŸ’¡

print(add(3, 4))  # Same thing as print(7)
print(add(1, 5))  # Same thing as print(6)
print(add(5, 3))  # Same thing as print(8)

# Here, the add() function is returning a value and that returned value is an argument for the print() function.
# The output would be:

7
6
8

# Print VS Return

# Well, print() functions can be anywhere in the program â€” inside or outside of a function, whereas return is the output of a function; you don't need to print out whatever you are returning.

# As a rule of thumb:
# Use return in a function when you want to send value(s) from one point in the code to another.
# Use print() in a function when you want to display some text to the user.

# Exercise

# Create a calculator.py program and define these five functions:

# add(a, b) that adds two numbers a and b.
# subtract(a, b) that subtracts two numbers a and b
# multiply(a, b) that multiplies two numbers a and b.
# divide(a, b) that divides two numbers a and b.
# exp(a, b) that takes a to the exponent (or power) of b.
# Make sure to return the result in each function definition.

# Test your calculator by calling each function once to make sure that it works!


def calculator_add(a, b):
    return a + b


print(calculator_add(3, 5))


def calculator_subtract(a, b):
    return a - b


print(calculator_subtract(5, 3))


def calculator_multiply(a, b):
    return a * b


print(calculator_multiply(5, 3))


def calculator_divide(a, b):
    return a / b


print(calculator_divide(6, 3))


def calculator_exp(a, b):
    return a % b


print(calculator_exp(5, 3))
