import random

# Example

# To define a function, we need a function definition. A function definition begins with the def keyword,
# followed by the function name, a set of parentheses, and a colon in that order.


# Hereâ€™s what a function definition looks like:
def say_hello():
    print("Howdy! ðŸ¤ ")
    print("How are you?")


# To call a function, we use the function name followed by parentheses somewhere in the code:
def say_hello():
    print("Howdy! ðŸ¤ ")
    print("How are you?")


say_hello()

# So the output would be:

# Howdy! ðŸ¤ 
# How are you?
