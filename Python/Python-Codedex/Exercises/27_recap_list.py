# Example

# Here's a recap of the chapter:

# Lists are used to store different items in a single variable.
# An index is an item's position in a list. Python lists are 0-indexed.
# Slicing can access certain parts of a list with name[start:end].
# Python has built-in functions like len(), max(), min().
# Lists have built-in methods like .append(), .insert(), .remove(), .pop().
# We can iterate over a list using for-in.
